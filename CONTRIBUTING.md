# Contributing to [bee4/activerecord](https://gitlab.com/bee4/activerecord)

Every contribution is welcome; either by [submitting](https://gitlab.com/bee4/activerecord/issues) 
bug issues or suggesting improvements, or in a more active form 
like [requesting](https://gitlab.com/bee4/activerecord/merge_requests) a merge.

We want to collaborate happily, code joyfully, and get alive merrily. 
Thus, below are some guidelines, that we expect to be followed by each 
contributor.

- **Be brief, but be bold**. State your issues briefly. But speak out your ideas loudly, even if you can't or don't know how to implement it right away. The world will be better with limitless innovations.
- **Test your code**. Nobody else knows your code better than you. So, it's completely yours mission to test the changes you made before pull request submission. We use [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) for our testing purposes and recommend you using this tool too. [Here](https://phpunit.de/presentations.html) you can find PHPUnit best practices and additional information on effective unit testing, which helps us making wordpress-project better day to day. Do not hesitate to smoke it carefully. It's a great investment in quality of your work, and it saves you years of life.
- **Request merge in separate branch**. Do not submit your request to the master branch. But create a separate branch named specifically for the issue that you addressed. Read [Gitlab manual](https://gitlab.com/help/gitlab-basics/add-merge-request.md) to find out more about this. If you are new to Gitlab, read [this short manual](https://gitlab.com/help/gitlab-basics/README.md) to get yourself familiar with forks and how git works in general.

We are using the [Git flow branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), 
so if you want to work on some improvements, you must start your branch from the `develop`, not the `master`.

That's it. Thank you for your interest in this lib, and welcome!

May the Force be with you.
